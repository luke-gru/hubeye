<h1>Hubeye</h1>

<p>Hubeye is composed of a client and server. Once the server is run,
you can connect to it via the client. Once connected, you'll be
prompted by a '>'. Type the name of a Github repository. </p>

<p>Example: (what the user enters is preceded by the prompt)</p>

<pre><code>&gt;hubeye
commit  77b82b54044c16751228
tree    8ce18af1461b5c741003
parent  ea63fe317fe58dff1c95
log tracking info for repos on client quit  =&gt; luke-gru
</code></pre>

<p>What you see is the latest commit reference, tree reference and parent 
commit reference on Github for that repository. Note that the user did 
not type a username. This is because the user defined a username in his
~/.hubeyerc file.</p>

<h3>~/.hubeyerc</h3>

<pre><code>username = luke-gru
</code></pre>

<p>This allows the user to type the repository name only, and to receive
information regarding that user's repository. The username must be a 
valid Github username.</p>

<h3>Keeping track of repositories</h3>

<p>Hubeye doesn't actually track any repositories unless you disconnect
from the server and leave the server running. This can be done by:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;quit
Bye!
</code></pre>

<p>If Hubeye has any repos to watch, it will watch Github for changes.
It can keep track of as many repos as you want; just keep typing
them in. If Hubeye finds a change in a repo, it will tell you that the
repo has changed in the terminal where the server is running. Also, next
time you connect to the server via the client, it will remind you. 
Hubeye does not remove a repo from the watch list unless explicitly 
told to do so.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;rm luke-gru/hubeye
</code></pre>

<p>this removes luke-gru's hubeye repo from the watch list. You can also
add another user's repo like this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;rails/rails
</code></pre>

<p>This adds https://github.com/rails/rails to the watch list.</p>

<h3>Shutting down</h3>

<pre><code>&gt;shutdown
</code></pre>

<p>Next time you start up the server, the watch list is empty.
In order to have a default watch list:</p>

<p>~/.hubeyerc</p>

<pre><code>default = rails/rails | dchelimsky/rspec
</code></pre>

<p>These will be watched automatically when starting up the server</p>

<h3>All ~/.hubeyerc configurations</h3>

<pre><code>username = luke-gru
default = username/reponame | username2/reponame2 | myreponame
oncearound = 90
</code></pre>

<p>oncearound: number of seconds before completing a check of every repo in
the watch list for changes</p>
